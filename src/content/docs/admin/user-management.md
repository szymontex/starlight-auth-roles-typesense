# User Management

In this section, we will cover how to manage users, roles, and permissions within the system.

## Creating a New User

To create a new user, navigate to the "Users" section in the admin panel and click "Add New User". Fill in the required information and assign the appropriate roles.

## Managing Roles

Roles define the level of access a user has within the system. The available roles are:

- **Admin**: Full access to all system features.
- **Editor**: Can create and edit content.
- **Company Member**: Access to company-specific resources.
- **Guest**: Limited access, primarily to view content.

## Permissions

Each role comes with a set of predefined permissions. These permissions can be customized per user or role as needed.
