# System Overview

Welcome to the system overview documentation. This section provides a detailed look at the architecture and key components that make up our system.

## Architecture

The system is built on a microservices architecture, which allows for scalability and flexibility. Each service is responsible for a specific part of the application, ensuring modularity and ease of maintenance.

## Key Components

- **API Gateway**: Manages the routing of requests to the appropriate microservices.
- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **Data Service**: Manages the persistence and retrieval of data.

### Diagram

Below is a simplified diagram of the system architecture:

This is a high-level overview, and each component will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.
