# Content Creation

This section covers the best practices for creating content within the system.

## Writing Guidelines

- **Clarity**: Ensure that all content is clear and easy to understand.
- **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent tone and style across all content.
- **Accuracy**: Fact-check all information before publishing.

## Tools and Resources

- **Markdown Editor**: Use the built-in markdown editor to create and format content.
- **Media Library**: Access the media library to add images and other media to your content.

## Publishing Workflow

Once the content is created, it goes through the following workflow:

1. **Draft**: The initial creation phase.
2. **Review**: Content is reviewed by an editor.
3. **Publish**: Once approved, the content is published to the live site.
