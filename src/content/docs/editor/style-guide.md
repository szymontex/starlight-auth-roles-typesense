# Style Guide

This style guide outlines the editorial guidelines to ensure consistency across all content created within the system.

## Tone and Voice

- **Tone**: Professional yet approachable. Avoid overly formal language.
- **Voice**: Use active voice wherever possible. For example, "The team completed the project" instead of "The project was completed by the team."

## Grammar and Punctuation

- **Oxford Comma**: Use the Oxford comma in lists for clarity.
- **Acronyms**: Spell out acronyms on first use, followed by the acronym in parentheses. Example: "Content Management System (CMS)".

## Formatting

- **Headings**: Use H1 for titles, H2 for main sections, and H3 for subsections.
- **Lists**: Use bullet points for unordered lists and numbers for ordered lists.
- **Links**: Use descriptive text for links, rather than "click here".
