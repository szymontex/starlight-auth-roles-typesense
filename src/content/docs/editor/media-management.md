# Media Management

This section provides guidelines on how to manage media assets within the system.

## Uploading Media

- **Accepted Formats**: The system supports common image formats such as JPEG, PNG, and GIF.
- **Upload Limits**: Each file must be under 10 MB in size. If your file exceeds this limit, consider compressing it.
- **Alt Text**: Always provide descriptive alt text for images to improve accessibility.

## Organizing Media

- **Folders**: Use folders to organize media assets by project or category.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and descriptive file names. Avoid generic names like "image1.jpg".

## Best Practices

- **Optimization**: Optimize images for the web to reduce load times. Tools like TinyPNG can help with this.
- **Copyright**: Ensure that you have the right to use all media assets, and provide proper attribution if required.
